# Notes

Google forms submit based on a RESTful get API. 

Here is an example of a GET that will count as a real response 

[GET](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7oQx2d3xdFwKDWTfZ7pZqgXuXLBnTngQHRCHNe9byfpS1Vg/formResponse?entry.729381056=Option+3)

I need to look into how google account specific ones work

The form options have a number that is encoded into the html.
This number is what the GET to record results.
